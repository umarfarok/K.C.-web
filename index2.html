<p>HISTORY</p>

<p>Kings College, Lagos, a boys-only Secondary School was established by an Act of British Parliament on Monday 20th of September 1909, with Mr. Lomax as its first Principal. The College (originally called King’s School, Lagos) opened with ten scholars. It was established to produce students of profound character and academic distinction – men who would build an independent Nigeria. In the words of the colonialists, the College was established</p>

<p>To provide for the youth of the Colony a higher general education than that supplied by the existing schools, to prepare them for the Matriculation Examination of the University of London, and to give a useful course of study to those who intend to qualify for professional life or to enter Government or Mercantile Service

<p>King’s College is a national institution, the nation’s numero uno in post primary education. Today, King’s College, Lagos, remains the best College in terms of prestige, character formation, discipline and academic excellence. Its contemporaries in West Africa are Achimota College, Ghana and Fourabay College, Sierra Leone. In England, Kings College compares favourably with Eaton College, Harrow and a few others.</p>

<p>In 1914, Sir Lord Fredrick Lugard, the Governor-General of Nigeria, described King’s College, Lagos, in a White Paper as “the leading school in the Colony as well as the Premier School”.
